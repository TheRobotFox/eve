#+title: Event System
* Reactive System
- Respond to Events
- Control Flow via Events
- Synchronous
- Spawn async Tasks

** Arch
*** Collect Events
Generators, Handlers
(keypress, Timeout, Packet recieved)
*** Consume Events
Consume or partially Consume Events
Sync and Async Actions -> Promise Queue
Scheduler for Event Handeling?
(keypress->GUIevent, network->update Value/create new Event)
*** Reactive class
gets event queue -> regsters notifys -> deaccloc on destruct
call member functions (MACROS)

** Example
- Click Event :: Spawn Click Event with screen pos
- Analyse Screen pos -> spawn specific event (Card Clicked)
- Card :: GUI Event + Send Packet
- Network disconnet :: Warining with Timeout
- AssetFiles Changed
- Asset Loaded

** Systems
*** Event Queue
- Contains spawned events
- Forward Events to specified Handlers, multiple possible
- Cleanup events once Handled
- Thread Safe??
- std::any
*** Handlerers
Add Handlers for specific Events
*** Timeouts and Watchers
- Set Timeouts -> spawn events
- timestamp queue
- Repeated Intervals
*** Async Jobs
- Spawn new Thread for Task -> wait for Promise -> Spawn Event
